    <p class="para1">border-width: The border-width property is used to set the border's width. We can also use the pre-defined values that are thin, medium, and thick to set the width of the border. It sets the thickness of the border. Its default value is medium.
        This property cannot be used alone. It is always used with other border properties like "border-style" property to set the border first; otherwise, it will not work.
        The width of the border can be different for every individual side. It can be done by using the border-bottom-width, border-top-width, border-right-width, and border-left-width</p>
